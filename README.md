# Particle & field
Thermal stochastic evolution of a particle in a fluctuating correlated scalar field

Written by Davide Venturelli & Benjamin Walter

This version: May 2021

The program simulates a d-dimensional system (with d up to 3) made of a particle and a field interacting with each other, and subject to noise. 

It runs on a single core, and uses a stochastic Runge-Kutta algorithm for the integration of their coupled stochastic differential equations.

This code (or variations thereof) has been used to perform the numerical simulations published and described here:
